/*
Heap Operations :-
1.Push
2.Pop Min/Max
3.Get Min/Max

Types of Heaps:
1.Max Heap : from which we can extract max element
2.Min Heap : from which we can extract min element

At a particular time a heap can be of either max type or min type, it cannot be both at the same time

For visualisation we should visualize a heap as a CBT , but store it in memory as an array
