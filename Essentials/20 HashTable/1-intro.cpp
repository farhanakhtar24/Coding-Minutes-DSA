/*
HashTable is a  key value pair data structure just like js objects

HashTable functionality :
1.Search -> O(1)
2.Insert -> O(1)
3.Deletion -> O(1)

The T.Cs of above functions have an average of O(1) time

HashTable are not useful for maintaing some king of an order of elements

If we want to store key value pairs in sorted structure then we should use map
and if we dont care about the order of map then we use the unordered_map

In map the queries take O(LogN) time
In unordered_map the queries take O(1) time
