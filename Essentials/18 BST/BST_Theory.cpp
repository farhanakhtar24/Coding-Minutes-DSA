/*
BST:It is a binary tree
left part and right part both should be BST
Nodes in left bst <= root val <= Nodes in right bst

Inorder traversal of BST will always be sorted as left nodes <= root <= right nodes

In Binary tree to search a node the T.C is O(n)
In BST searching T.C will be O(height of tree)
